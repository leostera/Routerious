#  Routerious
## ----------

###
#  Routerious is an extended Backbone.Router that includes utility functions
#  making it a good choice for a View-Master or Collection-Master Router
#  or even a mixup of those.
#
#  It also includes functionality for Router-wide model handling (such as a
#  global or router-wide user model or session model)
